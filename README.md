impulse
=======

Every project needs an impulse.

According to wikipedia, impulse is:
*    The gun powder accelerating the bullet in a rifle,
*    The bow string accelerating the arrow,
*    The rocket engines accelerating the shuttle,
*    The fist accelerating the punching bag,
*    **And now, Starting your project in seconds instead of hours.**

This repository will provide a barebones setup with boilerplate files and directory structure. Perfect for fiddling with html, learning javascript and playing with css. Probably not perfect for production sites.
